BASIC IDEA
To scrape the tweets of a user and lemmatize it to get root words
run it through a trained model for different emotion classes to get emotion of the tweet
Basic tkinter graphic interface to display results
Uses python3 tkinter nltk package Beautiful Soup and pickler
FUTURE WORK: To analyze the the emotion of the tweets over a period of time and to detect signs of depressions among actively social users
NOTE:due to lack of dataset training model may not be very accurate
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The files involved:
Trainer.py: python program that trains the neural network (run first)
Trainingdata.txt:contains the data required to train the model
switch3.py:tkinter app that connects trainer and tweets to display results
scrape1.py:scrapes tweets of a user given id and stores in twe.txt along with date and time
